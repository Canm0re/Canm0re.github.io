        <div className="max-w-3xl mx-auto">
          <p className="mb-4">When I was 17, I had a dream to become a doctor.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">I entered pre-med, fully aware of the fierce competition that awaited me.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">I locked myself in an intense routine, waking up at 7 AM for lectures and studying until midnight, every single day.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">One day, a classmate casually mentioned studying until 2 AM. I felt compelled to outdo him and started studying 20 hours a day, every day, for nine gruelling months.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">I even resorted to rubbing dissolved breath mints on my eyelids to stay awake. Every second mattered…</p>
          <p className="mb-4">The result? I got <strong>perfect grades</strong> and made it to medical school, <em>but at the cost of my mental health.</em></p>
          <p className="mb-4">In medical school, <strong>the volume of content doubled, and my previous method of studying 20 hours a day was unsustainable</strong>.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">I remembered walking out of a lecture after week 1 telling myself, "There is no way I can keep up anymore…"...</p>
          <p className="mb-4">I knew <em>I needed a better approach</em> if I wanted to do well without repeating last year's struggles.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">Over the next few years, I dove into thousands of research papers on learning, constantly building on the techniques I’d picked up from medicine.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">Eventually, I was confident enough to teach what I had refined to the students I tutored, and it worked!</p>
          <p className="mb-4">This obsession led me back to university, where I completed a Master’s in Education <strong>scoring the highest grade in every paper</strong> and was awarded the Dean's award for the top graduating student in the program.</p>
          <p className="mb-4"><em>And I only studied a few hours a day for 6 weeks…</em></p>
          <p className="mb-4">I discovered that many students, like myself, were stuck in a cycle of intense work, inconsistent results, and anxiety.</p>
          <p className="mb-4"><strong>The methods we were using were inefficient and unsustainable.</strong></p>
          <p className="mb-4">Recognizing this, I left my medical career to teach these effective learning skills full-time.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">Today, I work with tens of thousands of people from over 150 countries, helping them learn more efficiently and achieve their academic goals <em>without burning out.</em></p>
          <p className="mb-4">The reality is that most studying does not lead to learning. By actually understanding how learning works, you can transform your approach and achieve extraordinary results with less effort.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">This program is designed to help you <strong>unlock your true potential and change your life</strong>, just like it did for me.</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">What I realised about becoming a top learner (after 13 years)...</h2>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">To become a top learner, you need to understand 3 things...</h3>
          <ul className="list-none space-y-2">
            <li className="flex items-start">
              <span className="mr-2">✔️</span>
              <span>First, you still need to work hard. There's no magic pill to become an ultra-learner overnight.</span>
            </li>
            <li className="flex items-start">
              <span className="mr-2">✔️</span>
              <span>Second, becoming a top learner means changing your habits. If you're not willing to change, don't expect anything to change!</span>
            </li>
            <li className="flex items-start">
              <span className="mr-2">✔️</span>
              <span>Third, making the change is worth it to achieve the goals you want to achieve.</span>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-4">Seems simple?</p>
          <p className="mt-2">Here's the thing...</p>
          <p className="mt-2"><strong>Most people do not make this change.</strong></p>
          <p className="mt-2">Most people stick with their same learning methods for years, endlessly playing catch up and losing opportunities.</p>
          <p className="mt-2">In over a decade of coaching people to become top learners, the most important thing I've realised is that even if you teach someone "the best learning methods", it doesn't matter if they're still held back by something else.</p>
          <p className="mt-2"><strong>So what holds students back?</strong></p>
