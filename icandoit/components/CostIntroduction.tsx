          <p>For context, the starting rate for <strong>a private coaching session with me is $2,500 USD an hour</strong> <strong>with a 6 month waitlist.</strong></p>
          <p>But I understand this is not affordable for most people.</p>
          <p><strong>I did not come from a "family of money" and <em>I believe high-quality education should be accessible.</em></strong></p>
          <p>You could pay thousands of dollars for tutoring, but the iCanStudy Program offers what I believe to be a much more <strong>impactful solution</strong> at <strong>a <em>fraction</em> of that cost.</strong></p>
          <p>I invested 10+ years of my life to design this world's-first system of learning to learn. And if you're serious about academic success, I want you to achieve what I have without investing that much.</p>
