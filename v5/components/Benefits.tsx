                Frustrated with endless hours of studying but still not getting the grades you want? You're not alone. The problem isn't you—it's how you're learning.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-500">
                Are you tired of pulling all-nighters, drowning in textbooks, and still not getting the grades you deserve? You're not alone. The problem isn't your effort—it's the outdated, inefficient way you're learning. But what if you could study LESS, stress LESS, and score HIGHER?
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-500">
                That's exactly what the Nord Program delivers.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-500">
                Scientists have been studying the process of learning for decades. What they've discovered has revealed a fundamental problem in education systems with the way learning is being approached by students all over the world.

              <p className="text-lg text-gray-500">
                Even with faster and greater access to information than at any other time in history, students are working harder, studying for longer hours and stressing more… and yet their results are not where they want them to be.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-500">
                Even top students report that they are struggling to keep up with their study load, particularly as their courses progress to more challenging levels.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-500">
                Despite extra effort and access to information, the studies are showing that our results are not a reflection of effort or even natural intelligence.
              </p>
              <p className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900">
                This is exactly why studying harder and feeling like you're not achieving what you want to…
              </p>
              <p className="text-2xl font-bold text-red-600">
                Is not your fault!
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-500">
                In fact, we now know that our results, retention and depth of understanding are a direct reflection of the "Learning Process" we use.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-500">
                Neuroscience is showing us that the quality of knowledge and retention in the future is predictable based on the learning process we use today.
              </p>
              <p className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900">
                How different would life be if you could study less, cover more and achieve 95% or more in your next exam?
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-500">
                This is exactly what happens for learners when they join the Nord Program in as little as 4 weeks.
