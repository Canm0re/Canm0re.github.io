        <h2 className="text-3xl font-extrabold text-gray-900 mb-8">4 Reasons you shouldn't join:</h2>
        <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-4 text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
          <li>The community is on a new platform. We've NEVER tested it before. YOU are the guinea pig.</li>
          <li>There's NOTHING happening inside except for a library of content and a couple of weekly calls with this guy named Awab. Bummer right? And also a couple of exercises. So what...?</li>
          <li>It's $47 PER month. Not a one off. $47. Every-single-month. Can you imagine?</li>
          <li>There are only 10 spots. You're probably not even gonna be able to get in on time.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-extrabold text-gray-900 mb-8">This Is NOT A Good Fit For:</h2>
        <ul className="list-none space-y-4 text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
          <li>‚ùå <strong>For those not willing to put in the time and effort...</strong></li>
          <li>‚ùå For those who think this will change their lives overnight. <strong>It won't.</strong></li>
          <li>‚ùå For those looking for a magic bullet.</li>
          <li>‚ùå For anyone who expects to learn everything in 3 days and leave. <strong>This is a process. And it will take me time to transfer the information from my head to yours.</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">But it MIGHT seem like the community is still underdeveloped. And you wouldn't be wrong.</p>
